Your friendly neighbourhood investment bank is having trouble analysing historical price data. They need you to build a TCP server that will let clients **insert and query timestamped prices**.

## Overview

Clients will connect to your server using TCP. Each client tracks the price of a **different asset**. Clients send messages to the server that either **insert** or **query** the prices.

Each connection from a client is a separate session. Each session's data represents a different asset, so each session can **only query the data supplied by itself**.

## Message format

To keep bandwidth usage down, a simple **binary format** has been specified.

Each message from a client is **9 bytes** long. Clients can send multiple messages per connection. Messages are _not_ delimited by newlines or any other character: you'll know where one message ends and the next starts because they are always 9 bytes.

    Byte:  |  0  |  1     2     3     4  |  5     6     7     8  |
    Type:  |char |         int32         |         int32         |

The first byte of a message is a character indicating its type. This will be an ASCII uppercase `'I'` or `'Q'` character, indicating whether the message _inserts_ or _queries_ prices, respectively.

The next 8 bytes are **two signed two's complement 32-bit integers in network byte order** (big endian), whose meaning depends on the message type. We'll refer to these numbers as `int32`, but note this may differ from your system's native `int32` type (if any), particularly with regard to byte order.

Behaviour is undefined if the type specifier is not either `'I'` or `'Q'`.

## Insert

An _insert_ message lets the client **insert a timestamped price**.

The message format is:

    Byte:  |  0  |  1     2     3     4  |  5     6     7     8  |
    Type:  |char |         int32         |         int32         |
    Value: | 'I' |       timestamp       |         price         |

The first `int32` is the _timestamp_, in seconds since 00:00, 1st Jan 1970.

The second `int32` is the _price_, in pennies, of this client's asset, at the given timestamp.

Note that:

  * Insertions _may_ occur out-of-order.
  * While rare, prices can go negative.
  * Behaviour is undefined if there are multiple prices with the same timestamp from the same client.

For example, to insert a price of _101_ pence at timestamp _12345_, a client would send:

    Hexadecimal: 49    00 00 30 39    00 00 00 65
    Decoded:      I          12345            101

(Remember that you'll receive 9 raw bytes, rather than ASCII text representing hex-encoded data).

## Query

A _query_ message lets the client **query the average price over a given time period**.

The message format is:

    Byte:  |  0  |  1     2     3     4  |  5     6     7     8  |
    Type:  |char |         int32         |         int32         |
    Value: | 'Q' |        mintime        |        maxtime        |

The first `int32` is _mintime_, the earliest timestamp of the period.

The second `int32` is _maxtime_, the latest timestamp of the period.

The server must compute the **mean** of the inserted prices with timestamps T, **mintime <= T <= maxtime** (i.e. timestamps in the closed interval _[mintime, maxtime]_). If the mean is not an integer, it is acceptable to round **either up or down**, at the server's discretion.

The server must then **send the mean to the client** as a single `int32`.

If there are no samples within the requested period, or if _mintime_ comes after _maxtime_, the value returned should be 0.

For example, to query the mean price between _T=1000_ and _T=100000_, a client would send:

    Hexadecimal: 51    00 00 03 e8    00 01 86 a0
    Decoded:      Q           1000         100000

And if the mean price during this time period were _5107_ pence, the server would respond:

    Hexadecimal: 00 00 13 f3
    Decoded:            5107

(Remember that you'll receive 9 raw bytes, and send 4 raw bytes, rather than ASCII text representing hex-encoded data).

## Example session

In this example, "`-->`" denotes messages from the server to the client, and "`<--`" denotes messages from the client to the server.

        Hexadecimal:                 Decoded:
    <-- 49 00 00 30 39 00 00 00 65   I 12345 101
    <-- 49 00 00 30 3a 00 00 00 66   I 12346 102
    <-- 49 00 00 30 3b 00 00 00 64   I 12347 100
    <-- 49 00 00 a0 00 00 00 00 05   I 40960 5
    <-- 51 00 00 30 00 00 00 40 00   Q 12288 16384
    --> 00 00 00 65                  101

The client inserts _(timestamp,price)_ values: _(12345,101)_, _(12346,102)_, _(12347,100)_, and _(40960,5)_. The client then queries between _T=12288_ and _T=16384_. The server computes the mean price during this period, which is _101_, and sends back _101_.

## Other requirements

Make sure you can handle at least 5 simultaneous clients.

Where a client triggers undefined behaviour, the server can do anything it likes _for that client_, but must not adversely affect other clients that did not trigger undefined behaviour.
